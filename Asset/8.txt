Machine learning enables computers to learn and improve at tasks without explicit programming.
Computers learn by identifying statistical patterns within data and establishing algorithms for future data sorting.
An example algorithm is finding an optimal line to separate cats from dogs in image recognition.
Machine learning is widely used in facial recognition, text to speech recognition, spam filters, online recommendations, and fraud detection.
Researchers at the University of Oxford are utilizing machine learning to solve complex problems efficiently with less computing power.
