Neural networks are an important topic in artificial intelligence, with numerous applications such as Google Translate and Google Assistant.
Neural networks mimic the connectivity and information processing of neurons in the human brain.
The aim of neural networks in artificial intelligence is to replicate the learning and training abilities of the human brain in machines.
Traditional computers excel in computation and calculations but struggle with tasks like facial recognition, where neural networks shine.
Neural networks utilize learning algorithms to improve and train themselves, enabling them to recognize patterns and generate meaningful outputs.
