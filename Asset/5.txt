Neural networks are the basis of deep learning, a subfield of machine learning inspired by the structure of the human brain.
Neural networks take in data, train themselves to recognize patterns, and make predictions for new similar data.
Neural networks consist of layers of neurons, including input, hidden, and output layers.
The process of forward propagation sends data through the network, while back propagation adjusts weights based on the error between predicted and actual outputs.
Neural networks have various applications, such as facial recognition, forecasting, and music composition.
