Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
Deep learning uses artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain's structure.
Deep learning allows machines to independently identify features without human intervention, but it requires a large volume of data for training.
Neural networks consist of layers of neurons connected by weighted channels, with each neuron having a bias and an activation function.
Deep learning is applied in various fields such as customer support, medical care, and self-driving cars, but it faces limitations in terms of data requirements, computational power, and training time.
