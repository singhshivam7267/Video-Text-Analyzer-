 scientists have delivered three times a year a box of seeds is about to go through the first line of security in an isolated mountain in the sal bard islands . the store is designed to survive any natural disaster the seeds can last here for a very long tidal wave . if the worst happens and global warming melts all of the polar ice caps this project will still be safe . the pharaohs thought that their pyramids would last long and they did the last barrier to the store itself . there are samples of nearly half of the most important food crops brought here . seeds from Syria plants that are good at coping with drought and some have just been returned to the Middle East when harvests are ruined by extreme weather . in the remote mountains of svalbard in the arctic we have a lot of problems seeing us now climate change environmental problems and to tackle that we need a genetic variation . in these remote mountains this place is meant to be a safeguard against apocalypse an insurance policy .
