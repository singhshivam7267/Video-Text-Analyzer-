The stadium, built at a cost of Rs 127 crore, with 90 per cent of the funds borne by the Centre, was inaugurated by the CM on December 16 last year. BJP national general secretary Rituraj Sinha said he was amused how a stadium can be declared ?incomplete and unavailable? for use for the PM's rally just two months after inauguration.

"Is Conrad Sangma and Mukul Sangma scared of us (BJP)? They are trying to stall the BJP's wave in Meghalaya. You can try and stop PM's rally but the people of the state have made up their minds (to support the BJP)," he said.

Sinha asserted that seeing people's response to rallies of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and other star campaigners of the BJP, other parties have been taken aback.

Senior BJP leader A L Hek said the PM will hold a roadshow in Pynthorumkhrah constituency in Shillong on February 24.
